## Testing

Run the tests with `yarn test`, no separate compile step is necessary.

* See also the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).
* The tests can be automatically run in CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI): [`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`](https://github.com/0xReplicant/cryptfolio/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml).


## Linting & Prettifying

[ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) are used in combination to help catch minor code quality and style issues.

### Running Linting

The linting and prettifying is all run through a single command

    yarn lint

## Documentation

You can auto-generate API documentation from the TyoeScript source files using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/). The generated documentation can be published to GitHub / GitLab pages through the CI.

Generate the documentation, using `src/main.ts` as entrypoint (configured in package.json):

    yarn docs

The resulting HTML is saved in `docs/`.

You can publish the documentation through CI:
* [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/): See [`.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`](https://github.com/0xReplicant/cryptfolio/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml)
